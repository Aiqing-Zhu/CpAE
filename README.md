# PyTorch Implementation of: Continuity-Preserving Convolutional Autoencoders for Learning Continuous Latent Dynamical Models from Images

This repository contains code to reproduce the results as presented in the paper: Continuity-Preserving Convolutional Autoencoders for Learning Continuous Latent Dynamical Models from Images.

## Requirements 
* `environment.yml`

## Reproducing the Results of the Paper
All necessary parameters are specified in the paper. The code for our experiments is implemented using the [PyTorch framework](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJJsrmfCZ) and executed on RTX 3090 GPUs.

### Running Experiments for Circular Motion
```
python Test.py
```

### Running Experiments for Single Pendulum and Elastic Double Pendulum
To generate data, run:
```
make_data.ipynb
```
After generating the data, run:
```
sh TrainSP.sh
sh TrainEP.sh
```

### Running Experiments for Double Pendulum and Swing Stick
#### Data Preparation
The real-world data are provided by:
